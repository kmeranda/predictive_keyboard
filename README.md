To run code for 1, use python 3 to run keyboard1.py with an argument that is a path to training data. It will open the keyboard ui that can demo the probability based on the key size. Upon clicking each key, the keys will grow and shrink based on their probability based on the past 10 characters that were typed

To run code for 2, use python 3 to run eng.py with an argument that is a path to training data. It will automatically run all of the tests on dev and print out the output for each of the parts of #2. Note: this one uses keyboard1.py

To run code for 3, use python 3 to run chi.py with an argument that is a path to training data. It will automatically run all of the tests on dev and print out the output for each of the parts of #2. Note: this one uses keyboard2.py
	Note: if a pronunciation was only one character, I considered the probability that it was just the character itself versus a chinese character
